                       <p>Thomas William Maxwell Latham (born 2 April 1992) is a New Zealand international cricketer who is vice-captain of the New Zealand cricket team in Tests and ODIs. He is the son of former cricketer Rod Latham. He has the highest number of centuries among the New Zealand openers in Tests.</p>
                       <p>He is primarily a batsman who also plays as a wicket-keeper. Playing for Canterbury, he made his first-class cricket debut against Central Districts in 2010 in the Plunket Shield. He was selected for the One-Day International series against Zimbabwe in 2012 and made his ODI debut on 3 February 2012. He made his Test match debut against India in February 2014.</p>
                       <p>Latham scored 24 runs on debut, batting at number five, in an ODI against Zimbabwe in 2012. He made his Twenty20 International debut against the West Indies on 30 July, making 15 and 19 in the series. Latham also played in the tour's ODI series but failed to contribute significantly, his highest score being 32. He was recalled against Bangladesh, where he played a bright innings of 43 while opening the batting, and scored a match-winning 86 off 68 balls during the following tour of Sri Lanka.</p>
                       <p>He made his Test match debut against India in February 2014, with scores of 29 and 0. He then toured the West Indies with New Zealand in June, playing in all three Tests and two T20s. He had a highly successful Test series, scoring three half-centuries and 288 runs in total, finishing second in the series list of top run scorers, just behind teammate Kane Williamson. In doing so he helped his side to an overseas series victory. By July 2014 he had claimed the spot of opener after a run of poor 
                        form for incumbents Hamish Rutherford and Peter Fulton. His first Test century was achieved against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, on 11 November 2014; he scored 103.</p>
